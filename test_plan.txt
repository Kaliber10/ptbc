Test Plan
1. Having an empty /types folder (Success)
	a. Have no json files in /types
	b. Run Code
	c. Ensure that the program ends with "No Valid Entry Found For Type Matchups!"
2. Test the possible errors in a json file.
	a. Have a json file that doesn't have 'matchups' entry.
	b. Have a json file that is not syntactically correct.
	c. 'matchups' entry is not a list.
	d. 'resistances', 'weaknesses', 'immunities' entry is missing from a type.
	e. 'resistances', 'weaknesses', 'immunities' has the wrong case.
	f. 'resistances', 'weaknesses', 'immunities' contains a type that doesn't exist.
	g. 'resistances', 'weaknesses', 'immunities' has the wrong casing for a type.
	h. 'resistances', 'weaknesses', 'immunities' has a duplicate type respectively.
	i. 'resistances', 'weaknesses', 'immunities' has a duplicate type between them.
	j. Ensure the proper error is displayed.
	h. Ensure that they aren't listed as valid.
3. Having no algorithm files.
	a. Have no py files in /algorithms
	b. Run Code
	c. Ensure that the program ends with "No Valid Entry Found For Algorithms!"
4. Test the possible errors in the alorithms
	a. Have an algorithm without generate_scores.
	b. Have an algorithm with a variable generate_scores.
5. Valid Jsons
	a. Have a valid json file.
	b. It will not ask for a type matchup as only one exists.
	c. Have multiple json files.
	d. Choose a non number ("a") when the option presents itself.
	e. Ensure that it says "a" is not a valid number.
	f. Enter a number above the range, and a number under the range.
	g. Ensure those aren't considered valid.
	h. Enter the edge of the range.
	i. Ensure those are considered valid.
6. Valid algorithms
	a. Have a valid algorithm.
	b. It will not ask to choose as there is only one.
	c. Have multiple valid algorithms.
	d. Choose a non number ("a") when the option presents itself.
	e. Ensure that it says "a" is not a valid number.
	f. Enter a number above the range, and a number under the range.
	g. Ensure those aren't considered valid.
	h. Enter the edge of the range.
	i. Ensure those are considered valid.
7. Exception in algorithm
	a. Create an algorithm to throw an exception.
	b. Ensure the program handles it with a message.
8. Invalid Scores
	a. Have an algorithm return None.
	b. Have an alorithm return not a list.
	c. Ensure the list is of length 2. (Offense and Defense)
	d. Ensure that the entries for the list are dictionaries.
	e. Ensure the length of entries of said dictionaries are the same length as types.
	f. Ensure that the keys of the dictionaries match the types list.
	g. Ensure that the values in the dictionaries are only numbers.
	h. Ensure nothing else is in the dictionaries.
9. Error in Imports
	a. Have an algorithm that throws an error when trying to import.
