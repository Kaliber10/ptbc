## Types Matchups
Different Type Matchups are stored as json files in "types/".   
The default json file is based on the current Pokemon type matchup.

## Algorithms
Different algorithms to generate scores used to determine balance are stored in "algorithms/".
The algorithms are only found when in the root "algorithms/" directory, and won't be found in any directory higher.
